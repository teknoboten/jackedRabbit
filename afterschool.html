  <td data-title="Description" data-type="" class="">
    A welcoming space for kids to learn about and explore the world of Dungeons
    and Dragons (D&amp;D)! This program will teach kids the rules of the game,
    and they will also embark upon an exciting adventure. D&amp;D is a
    role-playing game where players use their imaginations to take on the role
    of adventurers in a fantasy world - they embark on quests, solve problems,
    and defeat villains. One person, called the Game Master, guides the story
    and sets the challenges (that’s us!) (TIP FOR PARENTS: D&amp;D has kids
    learning &amp; practicing a ton of life skills without them even being aware
    of it!)

        Are you ready to try your first game of Dungeons & Dragons?

Join us on this adventure and we'll show you the ropes!

Learn to Play D&D: Introductory Adventure is meant to be a one-time primer to get some experience before joining our upcoming D&D campaigns. One of our Game Masters will guide you through the rules in various scenes that highlight the three pillars of Dungeons & Dragons – Social Encounters, Exploration and Combat.

This 3-hour session is for teens ages 13 to 18, and is the perfect opportunity to gain the experience needed to join other D&D programs we offer both during spring break and after school!

Note: you do not need to come to this adventure with a character - we will have one ready for you.
